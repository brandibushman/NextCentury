# General Ideas
### For the Company
- I want it to provide a timeline- here is when a release went out, an update, billing, new products hit, a news letter, etc. And show how that is affecting out job. 
- Show what types of requests we get from which billing companies to shape training materials offered as well as support site.
- Track which bugs are the buggiest. Either the most malicious or most frequently occuring.
### For Support 
- Track who is doing what kind of work 
- Track the reponse time 
- Track if the same person is asking the same questions over and over again. 
- Develop internal training materials.
