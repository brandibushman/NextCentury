# Version 2.1.0
## Goals 
- API Integration to automate information: 
Property Name, Current Billing Comanpy, Current Gateway ID number, number of units, number of meters, number of repeaters, offline/online, etc

### Concerns
- We want to get a snap shot of up to date information. 
If the name is Alice in Wonderland on 9/1/20 and Horton Hears a Who onh 9/5/20 we want to be able to search for "Alice in Wonderland" and see it come up.
