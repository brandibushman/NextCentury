### Relavent Information for accomplishing this task
[Java Basics](https://github.com/brandibushman/NextCentury-again/blob/master/Java%20Basics)

## Questions
- Does the Java integration support HTML if you call it? - Not in streak
- Is there a way to have drop down cells that are based on the previous cell's input? - Not through streak alone
-  Can we reference the unique ID - yes 

## Current Organization
- support tags are less organized probably 
- things change so from communication issue to brown out issue

## Issues 
- Changing the tags effects the things. Support type tag would be the easiest. What do the 5 tags mean.
