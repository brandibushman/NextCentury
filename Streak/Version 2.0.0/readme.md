# Goals
- H Version 2.0.0 : 
- [Multiple Property Link](https://github.com/brandibushman/NextCentury/blob/master/Streak/Version%202.0.0/Multiple%20Properties.md) which can be entered as ``` Property Name (ID:#) ,, Property2 (ID:#)``` **Done**
- Have the "issue, information" make available the sub-categories **Pushed to Later Project- look into API*
- [Auto link by property code](https://github.com/brandibushman/NextCentury-again/blob/master/Streak/By%20Property%20Thread.md) with the same property code. Similar to the by person thing. **This could only be done by making each property a contact**
- Standardize and go through duplicates: hover over description (?) or Wiki cheat sheet. FLow chart or explanation. "Icom - Internal Communication" so we have hyphenate, "Ecom - Electronic Communication" **Done**
- [Adjust Tags](https://github.com/brandibushman/NextCentury/blob/master/Streak/Version%202.0.0/Tags.md)
  - Alternative to N/A **Alternative to N/A for properties was created**
  - how does it handle multiple tags THERE ARE OVER 11,000 boxes
  - Standardize and go through duplicates: hover over description (?) or Wiki cheat sheet. FLow chart or explanation. "Icom - Internal Communication" so we have hyphenate, "Ecom - Electronic Communication"

### Relavent Information for accomplishing this task
[Java Basics](https://github.com/brandibushman/NextCentury-again/blob/master/Java%20Basics)

## Questions
- Does the Java integration support HTML if you call it? - Not in streak
- Is there a way to have drop down cells that are based on the previous cell's input? - Not through streak alone
-  Can we reference the unique ID - yes 

## Current Organization
- support tags are less organized probably 
- things change so from communication issue to brown out issue

## Issues 
- Changing the tags effects the things. Support type tag would be the easiest. What do the 5 tags mean.
