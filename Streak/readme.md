## Current Goals
- Integrat API to auto populate information for properties 
- Have the "issue, information" make available the sub-categories 
- [Auto link by property code](https://github.com/brandibushman/NextCentury-again/blob/master/Streak/By%20Property%20Thread.md) with the same property code. Similar to the by person thing. 
- Date Reported/Response Time
- More integration between streak and our website. Streak has an API
- [Data Clean Up - Tags](https://github.com/brandibushman/NextCentury/blob/master/Streak/Version%202.0.0/Tags.md)
  - Alternative to N/A
  - create a more concrete list of choices - data clean up
- Standardize the phone number and contact information entering system like either it is all at once, or there are "."/"-" separators. 

## Current Questions
- Does the Java integration support HTML if you call it? 
- Is there a way to have drop down cells that are based on the previous cell's input?
-  Can we reference the unique ID

## Current Issues 
- Changing the tags effects the things. Support type tag would be the easiest. What do the 5 tags mean.

# Notes
Rachel's thoughts
WRT Missed Calls - where we're tracking statistics on the RingCentral side it is more like the times that it was missed and voicemails information relevance. Is it showing that maybe it was really busy that day, they were calling back, is this a person who calls a lot. 

Examine the experience of the meeting we had and how to sell it in order to get the most accurate information. 

In the past internal has been used exclusively for us. 
We will put it under request. 

Things Mikes asks about 
- who is calling us and what are they asking us about.
