## Things that I did
The first thing I had to do was learn about the existing system. I quickly discovered that the existing system wasn't documented and wasn't observed by majority of the team. So I had to learn what the team was doing. That was the first part.

Then I had to combine what people were doing, document it, propose a standard practice, present and agree upon it. Then I had to look through every box created for several weeks and work to get everyone on the same page. 

Once we were all working on the "old system" I had to find ways to improve it. 
- improved the links so that we could link multiple properites to one box
- created definitions and a process for which data points belong in which sections and why
- Got rid of some data points which were not being used
- renamed almost all of the data points
- teach my team
- work with my team to discover the best ways to do this
- Create Documentation
- Create a data entry process
- Clean up existing data
- Work with the testing team to find better ways to document bugs
- work with software team to present evidence that lead to the opimitzation of the app
- Cleaned up "[Data Clean Up - Tags](https://github.com/brandibushman/NextCentury/blob/master/Streak/Version%202.0.0/Tags.md)" options so that there was a finite set of well defined options. 
  - Alternative to N/A
  - create a more concrete list of choices - data clean up

## Current Goals
- Create a tracking code to generate a link to the tracking numbers for UPS, USPS, and FedEx.
- Integrat API to auto populate information for properties 
- Have the "issue, information" make available the sub-categories 
- [Auto link by property code](https://github.com/brandibushman/NextCentury-again/blob/master/Streak/By%20Property%20Thread.md) with the same property code. Similar to the by person thing. 
- Date Reported/Response Time
- More integration between streak and our website. Streak has an API
- Standardize the phone number and contact information entering system like either it is all at once, or there are "."/"-" separators. 

## Current Questions
- Does the Java integration support HTML if you call it? 
- Is there a way to have drop down cells that are based on the previous cell's input? Possibly using Zapier?
-  Can we reference the unique ID in some useful way. 

# Versions and their achievments 
### Version 2.1.0 :
### Version 2.0.0 : 
- Links for multiple properties, 
- New Support Types
- Flow Chart
- Eliminated unused columns
- So there might be a backdoor for the tokens

# Notes
Rachel's thoughts
WRT Missed Calls - where we're tracking statistics on the RingCentral side it is more like the times that it was missed and voicemails information relevance. Is it showing that maybe it was really busy that day, they were calling back, is this a person who calls a lot.
