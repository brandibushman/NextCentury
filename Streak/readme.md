## Goals
- Have the "issue, information" make available the sub-categories 
- [Auto link the properties](https://github.com/brandibushman/NextCentury-again/blob/master/Streak/By%20Property%20Thread.md) with the same property code. Similar to the by person thing. 
- Standardize the phone number and contact information entering system like either it is all at once, or there are "."/"-" separators. 
- [Multiple Property Link](https://github.com/brandibushman/NextCentury-again/blob/master/Streak/Multiple%20Properties.md)
- how does it handle multiple tags THERE ARE OVER 11,000 boxes 
- Standardize and go through duplicates: hover over description (?) or Wiki cheat sheet. FLow chart or explanation. "Icom - Internal Communication" so we have hyphenate, "Ecom - Electronic Communication"
- Alternative to N/A
- Date Reported

## Questions
- Does the Java integration support HTML if you call it? 
- Is there a way to have drop down cells that are based on the previous cell's input?

## Current Organization
- support tags are less organized probably 
- things change so from communication issue to brown out issue
