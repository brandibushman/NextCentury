## Current Goals
- Integrat API to auto populate information for properties 
- Have the "issue, information" make available the sub-categories 
- [Auto link by property code](https://github.com/brandibushman/NextCentury-again/blob/master/Streak/By%20Property%20Thread.md) with the same property code. Similar to the by person thing. 
- Date Reported/Response Time
- More integration between streak and our website. Streak has an API
- [Data Clean Up - Tags](https://github.com/brandibushman/NextCentury/blob/master/Streak/Version%202.0.0/Tags.md)
  - Alternative to N/A
  - create a more concrete list of choices - data clean up
- Standardize the phone number and contact information entering system like either it is all at once, or there are "."/"-" separators. 

## Current Questions
- Does the Java integration support HTML if you call it? 
- Is there a way to have drop down cells that are based on the previous cell's input?
-  Can we reference the unique ID

## Current Issues 
- Changing the tags effects the things. Support type tag would be the easiest. What do the 5 tags mean.
