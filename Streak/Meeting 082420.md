# Meeting with the Streak Team 

## Questions 
- Linking by property ID: He thinks yes. Cannot work as cleanly as we want it to. **Not Possible** All that is required to create an organization is a domain or a name. I wonder if we instead can enter the URL to the property and then use that information to popular other things? Also you have to always opt in to adding the contacts and organizations. It is possible to add an organization via API and/or with zapier. 
- Dynamic columns so that if one column is a drop down and they pick value A then the next column would only have values 1-10 available to choose from.
**Not Possible. Nearest is to use data validation still not with Zapier**
- Why is it so glitchy and sometimes it takes a long time to load **Having a large Pipeline shouldn't be a problem. It is probably because of gmail?? So not scrolling but opening google. Chrome and streak are ram heavy. Grammarly fights for control with Streak. Their experience is that this is improving. If we notice a patter of we observe a pattern**

## API 
We have access to it so we don't need to pay more for it. 
The way that the product is built is accessable through the API. Pretty much all human things can be done with API
- Kirill knows fancy words


Kirill Thoughts - 
NextCentury API to update information in the contacts
[API Stuff](streak.readme.io)

Import out of googlesheets. but it won't create a contact list - that's fine.
