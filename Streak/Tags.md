# Fixing the Tags
## To Do
- Analyze the current Tags
- Learn how to have the drop down options be dynamic 

I think that we should add some issue types. Currently we have Issue, Request, Information, and Internal. 
As discussed with Kirill, Request is used heavily for both things that clients can do but don't or are unable to due to system failure and it is used for things that clients are unable to do such as backdate reads. So we can add Favors which would be things that clients should be able to do which would differentiate from things clients are unable to do. 

Also, information can sometimes turn into a really really long conversation where we walk someone through a huge process. If the explanation take longer than 20 min then that would qualify as a training. OTherwise it is information. 

I also think we should add a column that would be a check box for suspected bugs. 

# Quick Explaination 
- Issue- Was it NextCentury's Fault or not?
- Favor it was something the client should be capable of doing. So if the app was slow, the website isn't loading, they want us to upload the CSV file, or whatever it is still considered a favor because there should be capable of doing it. A key important thing is that it is something they can do AND have known at one point how to do it. So telling someone what the Gateway status is, is a favor. They key here is that they should be doing it because there are capable and have the permissions. 
- Request is something that the person is unable to do and need US (not the billing company) to do. So backdating, resetting passwords, transfers, deleting devices programmed to other properties etc. 
- Training is us walking someone through multiple steps or answering a lot of quesitons. Even if you do something like program a repeater, if it is a very informative situation it is a training. I think the key here is that the person is a newer client or just has completely forgotten how to do something. 
- Information is breif questions.  
- Internal - ???
# Scenarios

## Current Tags
If we explanded the euqipment to be WP-Programming (csv upload, )  (Web portal) 

Conflicitng if it should be type-tag- equipment it would be better whenever we are dealing with programming. Maybe programming could be an issue type? 
information-

Maybe the only time that wouldn't be helpful is if there was an RMA? As it is though like often webportal or app are the main issue and you program... a transceiver. so it doesn't make sense to go the other way. Transfers don't need to specify it is on the web portal WE KNOW if it is a transfer that it will go through on the webportal. 

SO I guess we need types and then to decide the list of services offered there. 
Favors - program, transfer, 
Information - confirm information, 
## Kiril's Imput

I typically put transfers under Requests > Web Portal > Transfer Request. I think that Request currently can represent 2 main interactions. 1) where customers simply want us to do something for them that they could do (programming, property edits, add users, etc) 2) where customers request something that only we can do (property transfer, delete devices programmed to other billing companies, etc) I think that these 2 could be split into their own categories because the outcome is different for both. 1) make tools and training more accessible. 2) automate the process and make it easier for users to make these types of requests. However, of the requests that only we can do, property transfers is the vast majority, so I think that it could go either way.

## Columns - 
Resolved Status is important incase people stop responding but I think it should be changed to a check box, but Final Contact Attempts and Prority are not being used. 

WE HAVE TWO DATE CREATE COLUMNS
I think we need to track if we are getting this favor asked because the system is too slow or not. But it is pushing the app - do you have it? Then finding out why they're not using it. 

Thinking of equipment type as "what did the support thing effect" except in obvious places. There are times that this would be empty. If there was a transfer you would leave it blank. This is where the resolver matters- are they leaving things blank out of negligence or out on purpose. Resolvers need to fill out their field because we need to keep track of who is consistent and reliable and who isn't. There will be mistakes made but the point is that the data is mostly reliable. I will be check literally every box at first and then will transition into actually making larger conclusions. Data from 2020 will be updated. Other data will be modified to be sure that information isn't lost. Columns that will be deleted will be complied and re-uploaded 

Also the naming convention matters... like why can't people just do their job?!!!?!?!!
