## Kiril's Imput 

I typically put transfers under Requests > Web Portal > Transfer Request. I think that Request currently can represent 2 main interactions. 1) where customers simply want us to do something for them that they could do (programming, property edits, add users, etc) 2) where customers request something that only we can do (property transfer, delete devices programmed to other billing companies, etc) I think that these 2 could be split into their own categories because the outcome is different for both. 1) make tools and training more accessible. 2) automate the process and make it easier for users to make these types of requests. However, of the requests that only we can do, property transfers is the vast majority, so I think that it could go either way.
