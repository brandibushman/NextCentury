<h1> Explanation </h1> 
Our <a id="top"> Streak Goals </a> are to inform the company what is happening in support as well as document for ourselves for future use. 

The essential cells to be filled out are <b> <a href="#Support-Type"> Support Type </a>, <a href="#Actions"> Action </a>, <a href="#property"> Property</a>,  and Billing Company </b>.

For the<a href="#Support-Type"> Support Type </a> and <a href="#Actions"> Action </a> we are focusing on what the actual issue/reason was and what <b> you did to resolve it </b>

For the other columns, <b> <a href="#efands">Property/Feature</a></b>, we are focusing on the equipment and or that was affected and/or was the root problem. So if you programmed, <i> what did you program?</i> If you troubleshot, <i> what did you troubleshoot <b>and</b> what was the issue? </i>


<center> <b> PLEASE READ THROUGH THE ENTIRE LIST OF FEATURES IN THE DROP BOX BEFORE ADDING NEW ONES AND TAG ME IN IT</b></center>
We are trying to avoid the duplicate situation that we have with the former support tags. Please also utilize the "Tab" descriptions rather than "Web Portal".




 <b> Any extra descriptions needed should be added to brief description. </b>

 <h1> Support Type </h1>
 
 <a href="#top"> Top </a>

The <b><a id="Support-Type" style="color:black">Support Type</a></b> is dividing the work into catagories that describes one of our 5 main functions. 
<ol>
<li> <b> Internal</b> - We are often a pivotal person who ensures that information gets to the right place. </li>
<li> <b> Information/ Training </b>  A huge part of what we do is education about the product, its use, its installation, and so much more. We are submetering tutors/teachers. There is a disctintion based off of the time restraint so that we know how frequently we are getting long calls.  </li>
<li> <b> Favors </b> - We get calls from distressed and busy people who want to use our expertise to obtain a time advantage and have not done much troubleshooting.  </li>
<li> <b> Request</b> - This is getting reserved for things that only we can do such as Transfers, checking telit (advanced troubleshooting) </li>
  <li> <b> Issue </b> - Mostly self explanatory  but issues can use anything that is already in the boxes to describe the problem  </li>
</ol>

<h1> Actions </h1>
 
 <a href="#top"> Top </a>


The <b><a id="Actions" style="color:black"> Actions </a> </b> is where you will describe what you did. There is a list of preferred options. This section is a little more diverse and requires you to make a judgement call because rarely do our interactions fall completely into one catagory. What ever the bulk of your interaction was. <i> If you feel like you have something that doesn't fit into a catagory or want to put more than one, tag me in the box. </i>
<h4> Requires Product and/or Feature</h4>


- <b> Programming </b> is for any time you have done programming. Adding a TR, RE, RR, GW, property, IMR, meter type, Etc. <br><sub>
 Examples: Property, TR201, GW301, RR301, 3rd Part Equipment, Backdate Reads, Editing User Permissions (Add User- this combination is understood to be editing permissions) </sub>

- <b> Troubleshooting </b> is for any time you are helping to diagnose the problem (with multiple steps)<br><sub>
  Examples:  GW301 > Cellular, GW301 (GW201) > Firewall </sub>
  
- <b> Status </b> is for when you are providing the status for something but not troubleshooting. Examples; is the Gateway online, did the transceiver check-in, is the property on cellular, etc. <br><sub>
 Examples: GW301 > Cellular , TR201 > Check-In Time, Password Rest </sub>

- <b> Repeater Layout </b>

- <b> Installation Instructions </b> is for any time you are assisting with the installation process. Examples include wiring, reset sequence information, documentation or link, compatibility questions, etc<br><sub>
 Examples: 3rd Party Meter > Compatibility, TR201 > Wiring, Status, Certifications</sub> 

- <b> General Information </b> This should be used sparingly. This would be almost exclusively used for informational calls where someone just asks a diverse number of questions and none are specific enough.<b><i>This can be used when someone calls as asks questions about which billing company they should pick or other information that we do not give out</i></b>

- <b> RF Range </b> is for things that are due strictly to the RF communication. If someone calls and there is low signal strength you would do that. 

- <b> Documentation  </b> this is when you are providing documentation.

- <b> Sales </b> this is when there are questions about sales. 

- <b> Equipment ?s </b> is for questions that have to do with the features of the equipment and not the installation. It will eventually be changed to Equipment Features. <b> <i> To be used sparingly </i> </b>

- <b> Feature Suggestion </b>



- <b> Montly Technician Feedback </b> should be nested under the Request Support Type. 

- <b style="color:green"> New </b> <b> Server  </b>

- <b> Training Invitation </b> is used when we are solicited for information on how to schedule and set up a training. It is also used if someone is in need of a training and links to sign up for a training have been sent.

<h4> Does not require Product and/or Feature </h4>

- <b> Property Transfer </b>

- <b> Billing ?s </b> is for anything related directly to billing. This will eventually be changed to just "Billing" but I went with the most commonly 
used option for ease of transition. 
- <b> Missed Call </b> should be nested under Request.<b> This is used when there is a missed call AND we were unable to talk to them. </b>

- <b> Add User </b> 

- <b> New Company </b> is for when you add any new company as a billing company, property opperator, manual reader, etc. 
<h4>Special Situations with Actions.</h4>

If you are doing an internal box type your "Action" will be the department that we are internally communicating with. That is the only time these should be used. 
- <b> Hardware Department </b>
- <b> Software Department </b>
- <b> Accounting Depatment </b>
- <b> Sales/Orders Department </b>

<h1> Property </h1>
 
 <a href="#top"> Top </a>


If it is NOT property related use <b> Not Property Related</b>. If it is about a property which is not yet in our system use <b> Not Programmed Yet </b>. If someone is calling about a property where a non-TR Remote Reader is programmed put <b> Not A NC Property</b>. This will cause the link to be an error. 

Enter property(ies) is really just about <a id="property" style="color:black">format </a>. It is essential that is in the format to be complient because this is what generates the link and will <i> (hopefully) </i> be how we create a link between properties that is more efficient.

<center> PropertyName (ID: ) </center>

Where the property name does not contain parenthesis. When there are multiple properties that needs to be addressed in a box you will need to separate them by a <b> double comma ,, </b>
<center>  PropertyName1 (ID: 1 ) ,, PropertyName2 (ID: 2 ) </center>

The Property ID number is found in the URL on the NextCentury Web Portal.

[![Capture.JPG](https://wiki.nextcenturymeters.com/uploads/images/gallery/2020-12/scaled-1680-/kNDcapture.JPG)](https://wiki.nextcenturymeters.com/uploads/images/gallery/2020-12/kNDcapture.JPG)

It is unqiue and won't change even if the property is transferred, re-named, or if a new Gateway is programmed to it.

<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">
<h1>Due to extended Loading </h1>
 
 <a href="#top"> Top </a>
 
 <a id="d2ex" style="color:black" > Due to extended loading </a> is to be used when people call in and are needing help because the app or web portal are taking too long to load. There is additional information needed when this happens. 
 
 <h4> Mobile App </h4>
If it is the mobile app giving them problems a check needs to be accompanied by a note that has the following information:

<input type="checkbox">1. Using WiFi or cellular data and comments on the signal strength. Purpose is to document the situations technicians are in when needing use of the app

<input type="checkbox">2. Type of phone they have. Purpose is to document if there is a type of phone that has more problems than other (Android vs Apple. Pixel vs Samsung)

<input type="checkbox">3. Their current location. Are they next to an elevator shaft? A window? In the ceiling? Is it plausible that everything is slow there?

<input type="checkbox">4. Email address they use to sign into the app. That way we can see if we get this from bigger companies due to loading.

<input type="checkbox">5. What part of App that is slowing down. Was it slow from the get go? Did they direct connect and then it was slow? Was it the search feature? Did it appear quickly and have inaccurate information?


 <h4> Web Portal </h4>
If it is the web portal giving them problems, a check needs to be accompanied by a note that has the following information:

<input type="checkbox">1. Is there internet working on other websites (like youtube)? Have them run an internet speed test.

<input type="checkbox">2. What web browser are they using? Are they using wifi or ethernet?

<input type="checkbox">3. Get information on any additional symptoms and what aspects of the sight are being slow. 

<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">
<h1> Possible Issue </h1>
 
 <a href="#top"> Top </a>
 
 <a id="pi" style="color:black"> Possible issues should be used when there isn't an explicit issue but there were a few things that seemed wonky and you want to note it that way. This is done so that if there are more situations with similar side effects we can go back and compare.
  
  <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">
<h1> <b style="color:green"> New </b>Contacts </h1>
 
 <a href="#top"> Top </a> <br> The <a id="cont" style="color:black" >Contact field</a> is required to be filled out. It also needs to include the company that the contact is associated with. 

  <center> <i>RingCentral is not required to be added for missed calls.</i> </center>

  [![contact picture.JPG](https://wiki.nextcenturymeters.com/uploads/images/gallery/2020-12/scaled-1680-/contact-picture.JPG)](https://wiki.nextcenturymeters.com/uploads/images/gallery/2020-12/contact-picture.JPG)
  
  <h3> Tips to make sure that the contact is the most up-to-date.  </h3>
 <center> Please search for already added contacts before adding a new one.<b> We are trying to avoid duplicate contacts. </b></center>  
  
  1. <b> Search the contact list first </b> using the information you know such as the name, number, or email. <br> If you are unable to identify the contact that way
 
  2. <b> Gather more information.</b> Search your <b>inbox</b> and well as the <b>User List in the Admin tab of the NextCentury website </b> to see if you can find more information to then search in the contacts section. <br> 
  
  3. Be sure to verify that their contact information is as up-to-date as possible (check their email signature).

  ## Reviewing Boxes Article
  ~~~
  The big thing here is honoring presidence and consistency. We want to stay consistent with the expectation, response quality, and logic flow. 

<sub> If you make a change to a logic flow let me know so we can . The previous boxes need to be updated and then the logic change needs to be documented, then on Friday we need to go over the logic change in the team meeting. </sub>

<b> Rachel may want to add to this (?) </b> but this is the proceedure that I have been doing in general but especially as it pertains to the boxes. 

I think of reviewing boxes in 3 main chunks. 
<ol> 
  <li> <a href="#cs"> Customer Satisfactions </a></li> 
  <li> <a href="#format"> Format </a> </li>
  <li> <a href="#bdi"> Box/ Data Input </a> </li> 
    
</ol>
<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">
<h3> 1. Customer Satisfactions </h3>
<a id="cs" style="color:black">Customer Satisfaction </a> is the most important aspect. Start by reading the email(s) and all the notes.

<input type="checkbox"> Has client's question was answered sufficiently. 

<input type="checkbox"> Is there more we could do next time or any other actions we should take based off of this interaction? 

<input type="checkbox"> Do they have a task that needs to be completed that they have not yet completed?

<b> If someone needs to respond </b> you can first chat them to see if it is on their radar. Otherwise put the box back to Inprogress, tag them in it, and specify what might be missing. 
<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">
<h3>2. Format </h3>
<a id="format" style="color:black"> Format </a> is important for consistency and for the data analysis. When it gets put into an excel format the titles gets separated based off of the "||". It then gets compared to the information in the boxes; especially the brief description. Cross check the information in the custom columns to the title. That is the benefit of having the point of contact and the property name documented twice, begin able to verify.

When you look at the title and contacts you are looking to see if it is formatted correctly. <sub> You will also pay special attention to the brief description after going through the tags. </sub>

<input type="checkbox"> Does the heading have 3 sections (4 for a call) separated by "||"?

<input type="checkbox"> Is the information in the correct order?

<input type="checkbox"> Did they get all of the information required? (As appropriate)


<input type="checkbox"> Did the create, update, and/or select the appropriate contact? 

<input type="checkbox"> If there are multiple properties is there a double comma between each entry in the cell?

<b> If there is an email. . . </b>

<input type="checkbox"> Did they change the brief description away from the subject line of the email?
  
<input type="checkbox"> If there is an email is there any other contact information that can be extracted from it? 

<b> If someone gets the formation wrong <i> consistently </i></b> (I usually do more than 3 of the same mistake) then message them and tell them that the boxes which are in the status Review need to have their whatever fixed. 

If they are making a <b> variety of mistakes </b> and most boxes have a mistake that are different, just send them a message them and ask if they want to go through anything. Be sure to let them the types of mistakes they were making, give them links to references, and keep in mind. . . they're probably just busy and need a loving reminder. 

<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">
<h3> 3. Box / Data Input </h3>
<a id="bdi" style="color:black"> The Box and Data Input </a> is important for the stats. To check the different custom columns it is important that you use the flow chart and preferred Actions list. There are a lot of examples in the flow chart. If you run across a unique situation please make me aware and make sure to document it somewhere. 

At this point most situations should be documented. 

<input type="checkbox"> Did they pick the appropriate Support Type per the flow chart? 

<input type="checkbox"> Pick the appropriate Action for the context? Is there a better choice? 

<input type="checkbox"> Do the other boxes appropriately fit the phone call? Would there need to be a different Equipment and/or Feature created or edited to fit this situation? 

<input type="checkbox"> Does the brief description provide any other information that would be desired?

<b> If someone gets the tags incorrectly </b> write a note with what needs to be fixed. Do not tell them exactly how to fix it, rather leave a link to where they can find this documenatation and a breif description as to where it can be found. Clarify if they need to put it back into review or if they can resolve after fixing.Change the Box Status to "Notes/Update".
