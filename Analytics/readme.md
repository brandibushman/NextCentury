# Goals

### Support Goals
- Reponse time
- Snap shot for after we have a new client 
- Things that are in stages for more than 7 days (5 working days)
- See where natural groupings are 
- **  Next Step Is coming up with a more efficient way of creating the charts and stuff**

### Company Goals
To create a timeline of how issues affect us and how they affect sales. I would really like to incorporate other data points such as sales of equipment and type of equipment, new property creation, properties deleted, properties put on manual reads, etc.
