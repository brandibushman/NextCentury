# Goals

## Goals (below might be deletable)
Welcome to the monthly Stats. We aim to answer the following questions.



Customer Experience
1. Who is getting help? (Is that different than who may need it?)
2. What do they need help with?
3. What are things we need to improve and where (training materials, support articles, app updates)?
4.  Is everything working the way it is intending?
5. Should we change the was things are working?

Internally

1. Who is doing the work?
2. What are they doing?
3. Do they need to do something different?
4. Do they need help?
5. What can we improve upon as a team?
6. What resources should we adjust, add, or take away to improve the customer experience.  


We have two main sources for data. We have the Streak Stats and the Ring Central Stats. Streak stats are subject to user error but contain more information about the customer experience. 



Call Questions

1. Who is answering calls?
2. When are calls coming in the most?
3. When are calls getting missed the most?

- Statistics in an accessible place so that they are available to support and the company at any time. 
  - Stats which are relevent to the support team and the company. Answering the questions who is calling? Why are they calling? 
  - Also answering the question if they need to be calling or not. We want to know if we are being helpful or educational to assess if we need more helpful tools or if we need to make onboarding/training/support site changes. 
  - What do we need to improve. 

### Support Goals

- Reponse time
- Snap shot for after we have a new client: how can we make it a smoother transition (what is the process and how can we accomodate them)
- Things that are in stages for more than 7 days (5 working days)
- See where natural groupings are 
- **  Next Step Is coming up with a more efficient way of creating the charts and stuff**

## We are going to start getting calls from everyone 

### Company Goals
To create a timeline of how issues affect us and how they affect sales. I would really like to incorporate other data points such as sales of equipment and type of equipment, new property creation, properties deleted, properties put on manual reads, etc. 

- Focusing on Conservice and where are they lacking knowledge
Things Mike has asked about 
- who is calling us and what are they asking us about.
