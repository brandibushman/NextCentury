- Statistics in an accessible place so that they are available to support and the company at any time. 
  - Stats which are relevent to the support team and the company. Answering the questions who is calling? Why are they calling? 
  - Also answering the question if they need to be calling or not. We want to know if we are being helpful or educational to assess if we need more helpful tools or if we need to make onboarding/training/support site changes. 
  - What do we need to improve. 

### Support Goals

- Reponse time
- Snap shot for after we have a new client: how can we make it a smoother transition (what is the process and how can we accomodate them)
- Things that are in stages for more than 7 days (5 working days)
- See where natural groupings are 
- **  Next Step Is coming up with a more efficient way of creating the charts and stuff**

## We are going to start getting calls from everyone 

### Company Goals
To create a timeline of how issues affect us and how they affect sales. I would really like to incorporate other data points such as sales of equipment and type of equipment, new property creation, properties deleted, properties put on manual reads, etc. 

- Focusing on Conservice and where are they lacking knowledge
Things Mike has asked about 
- who is calling us and what are they asking us about.
